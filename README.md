The only reason we forked this library is because version 4.0.0 of it broke our code: https://app.asana.com/0/565932419085682/841544179311868/f

We wanted to prevent someone in the future from upgrading this library again, so by doing this we're hoping that before upgrading you read this readme and then decide to not upgrade.
